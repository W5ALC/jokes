	kind of slumps down.  The pilot is standing near by and overhears the
	conversation...
	.
	The pilot pipes up, "Excuse me folks, I couldn't help but hear your
	situation, and I have a deal for you.  I'll take both of you up together
	and if you can both make the entire trip without saying a word,
	or even making the slightest sound, I'll give the ride for free.
	But if either of you make a sound, its $10 each."
	Well, Martha and Stumpy look at each other, and agree to take the ride.
	.
	The pilot takes them up, and starts to do loop de loops, twists, dives,
	climbs and spins.  No sound. The pilot lands the plane, looks back at
	Stumpy and says, "Sir, I have to hand it to ya, you didn't make even

	faced each other in a city park, until one day an angel came down
	from heaven.

	bushes, from which shortly emerged a good deal of giggling, laughter,
	and shaking of branches. Fifteen minutes later, the two statues emerged
	from the bushes, wide grins on their faces.
	.
	"You still have fifteen more minutes," said the angel, winking at them.

03/23	Joke of the Day**************************************

	"Salary Theorem" states:
	"Scientists and Engineers can never earn
	as much as administrators and sales people."
	This theorem can now be proved mathematically:
	Given:
	Power = Work / Time and,
	Knowledge is Power
	Substituting knowledge for power, we obtain: Knowledge = Work/ Time
	If time = money, then: Knowledge = Work/ Money
	Solving this equation for money, we obtain:
	Money = Work/ Knowledge
	Therefore, as knowledge approaches zero, money approaches infinity, 
	regardless of the amount of work done.
	Conclusion: the less you know, the more you make.

	The wife replies,
	"It's my husband -- he's driving me crazy! I'm going to leave him if
	he continues!" "How does he drive you crazy?" "For 20 years," she says,
	"he's been doing these stupid things. First, whenever we go out, he's
	always looking at the floor and refuses to go near anyone.
	It's very embarrassing." The marriage counselor is amused,
	"Anything else?" "He keeps picking his nose all the time!
	Even in public!" "Hmm, anything else?" probes the counselor further.
	The wife hesitates,
	"whenever we're making love, he NEVER lets me be on top!
	Once in a while, I'd like to be in control!" "Ah," says the counselor,

	"Your wife says that you've been driving her crazy.
	She might even leave you." The husband looks shocked,
	"WHAT? For 20 years I've been loving and considerate and
	I've always given her what she wants! What could be the problem?"
	The counselor explains,
	"She says that you've got these habits that are driving her crazy.
	First, you're always acting strange in public--looking at the floor
	and never going near anyone else." The husband looks concerned,
	"Oh, you don't understand! It's one of the few things my father 
	told me to do in his deathbed and I swore I'd obey everything he said."
	"What did he say?" "He said that I should never step on anyone's toes!"
	The counselor looks amused, "Actually, that means that you should not
	do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry."
	The husband looks sheepish, "Oh. Okay." The counselor continues,
	"And you keep picking your nose in public."
	"Well, its another thing my father specifically commanded me to do!
	He told me to always keep my nose clean." The counselor looks faint,
	"That means that you should not indulge in any criminal activity."
	"Oh," says the husband looking very stupid.
	"And finally, she says that you never allow her to be on top
	during your lovemaking." "This," says the husband seriously,
	"is the last thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed and
	it's the most important thing." "What did he say?"
	The husband replies, "In his dying breath, he said. Don't screw up."

	A little old lady went into the Bank of Canada one day, carrying

	lot of money!" After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff
	finally ushered her into the president's office (the customer is
	always right!).  The bank president then asked her how much she
	would like to deposit. She replied, "$165,000!" and dumped the
	cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course
	curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her,
	"Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where
	did you get this money?" The old lady replied, "I make bets."
	The president then asked, "Bets?  What kind of bets?" The old
	woman said, "Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your
	balls are square." "Ha!" laughed the president, "That's a stupid
	bet. You can  never win that kind of bet!" The old lady
	challenged, "So, would you like to take my bet?" "Sure," said the
	president, "I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!" The
	little old lady then said, "Okay, but since there is a lot of
	money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00
	AM as a witness?" "Sure!" replied the confident president.
	That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and
	spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls,
	turning from side to side, again and again.  He thoroughly
	checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no
	way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.
	The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady
	appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.  She
	introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet:
	"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!" The president
	agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his
	pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little
	old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could
	feel them. "Well, Okay," said the president, "$25,000 is a lot of
	money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure."  Just then, he
	noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against
	the wall. The president asked the old lady, "What the hell's the
	matter with your lawyer?" She replied, "Nothing, except I bet him
	$100,000 that at 10:00 AM today, I'd have The Bank of Canada's

	Because I'm a guy, I must hold the television remote control in
	my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I'll
	miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to
	survive by holding a calculator. 
	
	Because I'm a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle
	with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we
	call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh,
	and when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood and
	stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If another
	guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, "I used to be able
	to fix these things, but now with all these computers and
	everything, I wouldn't know where to start." We will then drink
	beer. 
	
	Because I'm a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me
	soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never
	get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue.
	
	Because I'm a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic
	groceries at the store, like milk, or bread. I cannot be expected
	to find exotic items like " Cumin" or "Tofu." For all I know
	these are the same thing.  And never, under any circumstances,
	expect me to pick up anything for which "feminine hygiene
	product" is a euphemism. 
	
	Because I'm a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I
	will insist on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will
	just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and
	has to put it back together.
	
	Because I'm a guy, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I
	don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen
	to a complete stranger-how the heck could HE know where we're
	going? 
	
	Because I'm a guy, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking
	about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I have
	to make up something else when you ask, so don't.
	
	Because I'm a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have
	your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or
	think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for
	mother's day is OK. I don't need to see it. Did you remember to
	pick up something for my mom, too? 
	
	Because I'm a guy, I am capable of announcing, "one more beer and
	I really have to go," and mean it every single time I say it,
	even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my
	buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it
	increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I'll
	be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my
	clothes into the front yard. What's the connection? 
	
	Because I'm a guy, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie.
	Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't. 
	Because I'm a guy, yes, I have to turn up the radio when Bruce
	Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell
	you every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the
	cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is
	buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave.
	Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating.  
	
	Because I'm a guy, I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought
	what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair
	of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks fine. Your
	hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now? 
	
	Because I'm a guy and this is, after all, the 90's, I will share
	equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the
	cleaning, and the
	dishes. I'll do the rest.

	A pastor of a church who was previously a sailor, was very aware
	that ships are addressed as "she" and "her".  He often wondered
	what gender computers should be addressed. To answerthat
	question, he set up two groups of computer experts. The first was
	comprised of women, and the second of men. Each goup was asked to
	recommend whether computers should be referred to in the feminine
	gender, or the masculine gender. They were asked to give 4
	reasons for their recommendation. The group of women reported
	that the computers should be referred to in the
	masculine gender because:
	1.  In order to get their atention, you have to turn them on.
	2.  They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.
	3.  They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the    
	    time they are the problem.
	4.  As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had
	waited a little longer you could have a better model.
	
	The men, on the other hand, concluded that computers should be
	referred to in the feminine gender because:
	1.  No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.
	2.  The native language they use to communicate with other
	computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.
	3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory
	for later retrieval.
	4.  As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find youself
	spending half you paycheck on accessories for it.

	get kicked out when you're too young, you get a gold watch,
	you got to work.  You work forty years until you're young
	enough to enjoy your retirement.  You do drugs, alcohol, you

	MARTHA STEWART LIVING FOR REDNECKS
	
	     PERSONAL HYGIENE

	     should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.
	2.   Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several
	     days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of
	     good money.
	3.  Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no,
	    as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter
	    the taste of finger foods.
	
	      DINING OUT
	1.   When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup,  
	     and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.

	     your fingers covering the label.
	
	      ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME
	1.   A centerpiece for the table should never be anything

	     bathroom wall two years ago."
	3.   Establish with her parents what time she is expected home

	2.   Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.

	mattered most of all Was the dash between those years.  
	(1900-1970) For that dash represents all the time That she spent
	alive on earth.... And now only those who loved her Know what
	that little line is worth. For it matters not, how much we own;
	The cars...the house...the cash. What matters is how we live and
	love And how we spend our dash. So think about this long and
	hard... Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know
	how much time is left. That can still be rearranged. If we could
	just slow down enough To consider what's true and real, And
	always try to understand The way other people feel. And be less
	quick to anger, And show appreciation more And love the people in
	our lives Like we've never loved before. If we treat each other
	with respect, And more often wear a smile... Remembering that
	this special dash Might only last a little while. So, when your
	eulogy's being read With your life's action's to rehash...
	Would you be proud of the things they say About how you spent
	your dash? Spend it well.

	Manager hums and haws and finally says he does have a low skill
	job on the "Tickle Me Elmo" line and nothing else.  The woman
	happily accepts. He takes her down to the line and explains her
	duties and that she should be in for 8:00 AM the next day. The
	next day at 8:45 there's a knock at the Personal Manager's door.
	The "Tickle Me Elmo" line manager comes in and starts ranting
	about the woman just hired.  After screaming for 15 minutes about
	how badly backed up the assembly line is the Personal Manager
	suggested he show him the problem. Together they head down to the
	line and sure enough Elmos are backed up from here to kingdom
	come.  Right at the end of the line is the woman just hired, she
	has pulled over a roll of the material used for the Elmos and has
	a big bag of marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece
	of fabric and takes 2 marbles and starts sowing them between
	Elmo's legs.  The personal managers starts laughing hysterically
	and finally after 20 minutes of rolling around he pulls himself
	together and walks over to the new employee and says: "I'm sorry
	I guess you misunderstood me yesterday.  What I wanted you to do
	was give Elmo two test tickles."
08/14	A young man was walking through a supermarket to pick up a few
	things when he noticed an old lady following him around. Thinking
	nothing of it, he ignored her and continued on. Finally he went
	to the checkout line, but she got in front of him. "Pardon me,"
	she said, "I'm sorry if my staring at you has made you feel
	uncomfortable. It's just that you look just like my son, who I
	haven't seen in a long time." "That's a shame," replied the young
	man, "is there anything I can do for you?" "Yes," she said, "as
	I'm leaving, can you say 'Good bye, Mother!'  It would make me
	feel so much better." "Sure," answered the young man. As the old
	woman was leaving, he called out, "Good-bye, Mother!" As he
	stepped up to the checkout counter, he saw that his total was 
	$127.50. "How can that be?" he asked, "I only purchased a few
	things!" "Your mother said that you would pay for her," said the
	clerk.
08/15	A man returned home from the night shift and went straight up to
	the bedroom and found his wife with the sheet pulled over her
	head, fast asleep. Not to be denied, the horny husband crawled
	under the sheet and proceeded to make love to her. Afterward, as
	he hurried downstairs for something to eat, he was startled to
	find breakfast on the table and his wife pouring coffee. "How'd
	you get down her so fast?" he asked. "We were just making love!"
	"Oh my God," his wife gasped, "that's my mother up there!" "She
	came over early and had complained of having a headache. I told
	her to lie down for a while." Rushing upstairs, the wife ran to
	the bedroom. "Mother, I can't believe this happened. Why didn't
	you say something?" The mother-in-law huffed, "I haven't spoken
	to that jerk for fifteen years and I wasn't about to start now!"

08/18	A farmer and his wife are given the gift of a parrot from a
	relative. The Parrot, being a male, sneaks out and screws the
	next door neighbours turkeys and rushes back home, but not before
	being caught in the act. The next door neighbours knock on the
	door and explain what the Parrot has been doing. The owners of
	the parrot reprimand him and tell him if he doesn't stop it he's
	going to shave the parrots head. That night the Parrot, overcome
	with desire, sneaks out and screws his neighbours turkeys again.
	The next morning the owner ties the bird down and proceeds to
	shave his head. The following morning is the Farmers daughters
	wedding, and in order to please the relative that gave them the
	parrot, they sit the parrot on a piano and tell him for his
	punishment he has to greet all the guests and tell them where to
	sit in the church. The parrot is doing fine. "Grooms side to the
	left and Brides side to the right". Until two bald guys walk in
	and he says, "And you two Turkey fvckers up on the piano with
	me!!!"
08/19	A pastor who had previously been a sailor, was very aware that
	ships are addressed as "she" and "her." He often wondered by what
	gender computers should be addressed. To answer that question, he
	set up two groups of computer experts. The first was comprised of
	women, and the second of men. Each group was asked to recommend
	whether computers should be referred to in the feminine
	or the masculine gender, and to give four reasons for that 
	recommendation. The group of women reported that computers should
	be referred to in the masculine gender because:
	1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.
	2. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.
	3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the     
	   time they ARE the problem.
	4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had      
	   waited a little longer you could have had a better model.
	   The men, on the other hand, concluded that computers should be 
	   referred to in the feminine gender because:
	1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.
	2. The native language they use to communicate with others of     
	   their kind is incomprehensible to everyone else.
	3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for 
	   later retrieval.
	4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself     
	   spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.
08/20	25 Things Women Want To Hear In 1999
	
	1)  Gee Sweetheart, let's skip dinner tonight  The only thing I'm 
	    hungry for is you.
	
	2)  Wow, I just don' t know what to do with this money we won in  
	    the lottery, so why don't you take it to the mall and see if  
	    you can find something to buy with it.
	
	3)  Hey, how about inviting your mother to spend the summer with  
	    us.
	
	4)  Oh go ahead and eat that third piece of chocolate cream pie.  
	    If it's one thing I hate it's skinny women.
	
	5)  What luck, they had a special rental rate at the video store
	    on romance movies.
	
	6)  How about I give you a nice massage and foot rub.  I really   
	    don't like sex that much anyway.
	
	7)  You know, that Pam Anderson just doesn't seem to have the     
	    brain power that I find so attractive in a woman.
	
	8)  What a break, I won a prize on the radio station....tickets   
	    to either the super bowl or the opening of the New York       
	    Ballet.  I got first choice so pack your bags for New York,   
	    we get to go to the ballet!!!
	
	9)  Be careful Darling...don't let it go too far down your        
	    throat.
	
	10)  Who wants to play golf when I can get to see how good the    
	     lawn looks when it's freshly mowed.
	
	11)  While your up Sweetheart, can you get me a glass of water.   
	     I think I've had enough beer.
	
	12)  Shoot, there's nothing on TV but football games. Let's go    
	     furniture shopping.
	
	13)  There ought to be a law against those porno movies.  Can you 
	     believe that there are guys that would actually want their   
	     wives to do those things they show?
	
	14)  Man I tell you, nothing feels better than getting all        
	     spruced up in a suit and tie.
	
	15)  I'm getting a little tired of steak on the grill.  How about 
	     a nice quiche.
	
	16)  You know, I think I'd really prefer the four-door sedan to   
	     that impractical Corvette.
	
	17)  Look at that...disgusting.  Why would she wear a short skirt 
	     like that with no panties?
	
	18)  Golly I think we're lost.  Let me find a gas station to ask  
	     for directions.
	
	19)  My golf clubs are only 30 years old.  Why don't you use the  
	     money my parents gave us to get something nice for the       
	     house.
	
	20)  If the guys call and want me to go to that new strip club    
	     with them, tell them I'm busy.  I really want to get the     
	     living room painted tonight.
	
	21)  You know Sweetheart, I'm really glad you don't like doing    
	     all those dirty things they write about in those stupid sex  
	     advice columns.
	
	22)  Sports cars are just such stupid little toys for men
	     who have never really grown up.
	
	23)  If you're looking for me later, I'll be over there looking   
	     at the home decorating magazines.
	
	24)  You know, we really don't visit your relatives enough.
	
	25)  Why don't you relax this weekend.  I'll take care of the     
	     cooking and housework.
08/21	The Smiths had no children and decided to use a proxy father to
	start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive,
	Mr.Smith kissed his wife and said, "I'm off. The man should be
	here soon". Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door
	baby photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. "Good
	morning madam. You don't know me but I've come to...." "Oh, no
	need to explain. I've been expecting you," Mrs. Smith cut in.
	"Really ?" the photographer asked. "Well, good ! I've made a
	specialty of babies." "That's what my husband and I had hoped.
	Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start ?" asked
	Mrs. Smith, blushing. "Leave everything to me. I usually try two
	in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed.
	Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread
	out." "Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for
	Harry and me." "Well madam, none of us can guarantee a good one
	every time.  But if  we try several different positions and I
	shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with
	the results." "I hope we can get this over with quickly," gasped
	Mrs. Smith. "Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time.
	I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be
	disappointed with that, I'm sure." "Don't I know !!", Mrs. Smith
	exclaimed. The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a
	portfolio of his baby pictures. "This was done on the top of a
	bus in downtown London." "Oh my goodness!!", Mrs. Smith
	exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief. "And these twins turned
	out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so
	difficult to work with." The photographer handed Mrs. Smith the
	picture. "She was difficult ?" asked Mrs Smith. "Yes, I'm afraid
	so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done
	right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to
	get a good look." "Four and five deep ?" asked Mrs Smith, eyes
	widened in amazement. "Yes", the photographer said. "And for more
	than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and
	yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and
	I began to rush my shots.  Finally, when the squirrels began
	nibbling on my equipment I just packed it all in." Mrs Smith
	leaned forward. "You mean they actually chewed on your ...... eh
	.......... equipment ?". "That's right. Well madam, if you're
	ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work." "Tripod
	??", Mrs Smith looked extremely worried now. "Oh yes, I have to
	use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to
	hold while I'm getting ready for action. Madam ?   Madam?.....
	Good Lord, she's fainted !
08/22	What did one saggy boob say to the other saggy boob?
	If we don't get some support soon, people are going to think
	we're nuts.
08/23	Goldie was sitting on a beach in Florida, attempting to strike up
	a conversation with the attractive gentleman reading on the
	blanket beside hers. "Hello, sir," she said, "Do you like
	movies?" "Yes, I do," he responded, then returned to his book.
	Goldie persisted. "Do you like gardening?" The man again looked
	up from his book. "Yes, I do," he said politely before returning
	to his reading. Undaunted, Goldie asked.  "Do you like
	pussycats?" With that, the man dropped his book and pounced on
	Goldie, ravaging her as she'd never been ravaged before. As the
	cloud of sand began to settle, Goldie dragged herself to a
	sitting position and panted, "How did you know that was what I
	wanted?" The man thought for a moment and replied, "How did you
	know my name was Katz?"
08/24	It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to
	change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to
	get into Heaven, you had to have a really bad day the day you
	died. The policy would go into effect at noon the following day.
	So the next day at 12:01 the first person came to the gates of
	Heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering about the new law,
	promptly askedthe man, "Before I can let you in, I need you to
	tell me about the day youdied." "No problem.", said the man.
	"Well, for some time now, I've thought my wife was having an
	affair. I believed that each day on her lunch hour, she'd bring
	her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him.
	So today I was going to come home too and catch them. Well, I got
	there and busted  in and immediately began searching for this
	guy. My wife was half naked and yelling at me as I searched the
	entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just as I
	was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony
	and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his
	fingertips!  The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from
	me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers
	until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed
	in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. In a rage
	I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on
	to throw at him. And oddly enough, the first thing I could grab
	was the refrigerator. I  unplugged it, pushed it out onto the
	balcony and heaved it over the side.  It plummeted 25 stories and
	crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that right
	after that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly." The
	angel sat back and thought for a moment. Technically, the guy DID
	have a bad day, and it WAS a crime of passion, so he announced,
	"Ok, sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven.", and let him in.   A
	few seconds later the next guy came up. "Ok. Here's the rule.
	Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died."
	"Sure thing.", the man replied. "But you're not gonna believe
	this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing
	my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and
	accidentally fell over the side! Luckily however, I was able to
	catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath
	mine. When all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of
	his apartment and starts cussing and stomping on my fingers!  
	Well of course Ifell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down
	which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I'm laying
	there face up  on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating
	pain, I see the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over
	the ledge and it falls directly on top of me and kills me!" The
	angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his
	story. "I could get used to this new policy.", he thinks to
	himself. "Very well.", the angel announces. "Welcome to the
	Kingdom of Heaven.", and he lets the man enter.   A few seconds
	later the third man in line comes up to the gate. "Tell me about
	the day you died.", said the angel. "Ok. Picture this.", says the
	man. "I'm naked inside a refrigerator...."

	9) you can't flirt your way out of a jam.
	10) "Women and children first."
08/27	Two priests are off to the showers late one night. They undress
	and step  in the showers before they realize there is no soap.
	Father John says he has soap in his room and goes to get it, not
	bothering  to dress. He grabs two bars of soap in his hands and
	heads back to the  showers. He is halfway down the hall when he
	sees three nuns heading his  way. Having no place to hide, he
	stands against the wall and freezes like he's  a statue. The nuns
	stop and comment on how life-like he looks. The first  nun
	suddenly reaches out and pulls his dick. Startled, he drops a bar
	of  soap. "Oh look," says the 2nd nun..."a soap dispenser." To
	test her theory she also pulls his dick...and sure enough he
	drops the last bar of soap. The third nun then pulls, first once,
	then twice and three times. Still nothing happens. So she tries
	once more and to her delight she yells..."Look, hand cream!"
08/28	A priest is walking down the street one day when he notices a
	very small boy trying to press a doorbell on a house across
	the street. However, the boy is very small and the doorbell is
	too high for him to reach. After watching the boys efforts for
	some time, the priest moves closer to the boy's position. He
	steps smartly across the street, walks up behind the little
	fellow and, placing his hand kindly on the child's shoulder leans
	over and gives the doorbell a sold ring. Crouching down to the
	child's level, the priest smiles benevolently and asks, "And now
	what, my little man?" 
08/29	A farmer buys several sheep, hoping to breed them for wool,
	chops,etc. After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep
	are getting pregnant  and phones a vet for help. The vet tells
	the farmer that he should try artificial insemination. The farmer
	doesn't have the slightest idea what this means, but not wanting
	to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when
	the sheep are pregnant.  The vet tells him that they will stop 
	standing around and will, instead, lay down in the grass and roll
	around. The farmer hangs up and gives it some thought.  He comes
	to the conclusion that artificial insemination means that he has
	to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck,
	drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings
	them back and goes to bed. Next morning, he wakes and looks out
	at the sheep.  Seeing that they are all still standing around, he
	concludes that the first try did not take and loads them into the
	truck again.  He drives them out to the woods, bangs each twice
	for good measure, brings them back and upon returning to home,
	falls listlessly into bed. The next morning, he cannot even raise
	himself from the bed to look at the sheep.  He asks his wife to
	look out and tell him if the sheep are laying in the grass. "No",
	she says, "they're all in the truck and one of them is honking 
	the horn."
08/30	A woman and a man are involved in a car accident; it's a bad
	one.  Both of their cars are totally demolished but amazingly
	neither of them are hurt. After they crawl out of their cars, the
	woman says, "So you're a man, that's interesting. I'm a woman.
	Wow, just look at our cars! There's nothing left, but fortunately
	we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet
	and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our
	days." Flattered, the man replied, "Oh yes, I agree with you
	completely!" "This must be a sign from God!" The woman continued,
	"And look at this, here's another miracle. My car is completely
	demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God
	wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."
	Then she hands the bottle to the man, The man nods his head in
	agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands
	it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle, immediately
	puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man. The man asks,
	"Aren't you having any?" The woman replies, "No. I think I'll
	just wait for the police..."
08/31	Consider the case of the Illinois man who left the snow-filled
	streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida.  His wife was on a
	business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. 
	When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick
	e-mail.  Unable to find the scrap of paper on which he had
	written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from
	memory.  Unfortunately, he missed one letter and his note was
	directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had
	passed away only the day before.  When the grieving widow checked
	her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing
	scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.  At the sound, her 
	family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen:
	Dearest Wife, Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your
	arrival tomorrow. 
	P.S. Sure is hot down here.
09/01	God created the mule, and told him: "You will be Mule, working
	constantly from dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back.
	You will eat grass and you will lack intelligence. You will live
	for 50 years. The mule answered: " To live like this for 50 years
	is too much. Please, give me no more than 20." And so it was
	Then God created the dog, and told him: "You will hold vigilance
	over the dwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest
	companion. You will eat his table scraps and live for 25 years."
	And the dog responded: "Lord, to live 25 years as a dog is too
	much. Please, no more than 10years And it was so. God then
	created the monkey, and told him: "You are Monkey. You will
	swing from tree to tree, acting like an idiot. You will be funny,
	and you shall live for 20 years."  And the monkey responded:
	"Lord, to live 20 years as the clown of the world is too much.
	Please, Lord, give me no  more than 10 years." And so it was.
	Finally, God created Man and told him: "You are Man, the only
	rational being that walks the earth. You will use your
	intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world. You
	will dominate the earth and live for 20 years."  And the man
	responded: "Lord, to be Man for only 20 years is too little.
	Please, Lord, give me the 20 years the mule refused, the 15 years
	the dog refused, and the ten years the monkey rejected And it was
	so. And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and
	live 20 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his
	back. Then, he is to have children and live 15 years as a dog,
	guarding his house and eating the leftovers after they empty the
	pantry; then, in his old age, to live 10 years as a monkey,
	acting like a clown to amuse his grandchildren. And so it was.	
09/02	An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of
	Guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of
	each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar
	and orders three more.  The bartender asks him, "You know, a pint
	goes flat after I draw it; it would taste better if you bought
	one at a time." The Irishman replies, "Well, you see, I have two
	brothers.  One is in America, the other in Australia, and I'm
	here in Dublin.  When we all left home, we promised that we'd
	drink this way to remember the day when we drank together." The
	bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.
	The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the
	same way: He orders three pints and drinks them in turn.  One
	day, he comes in and orders two pints.  All the other regulars
	notice and fall silent.  When he comes back to the bar for the
	second round, the bartender says, "I don't want to intrude on
	your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your great
	loss." The Irishman looks confused for a moment, then a light
	dawns in his eye and he laughs.  "Oh, no," he says, "everyone's
	fine.  I've just quit drinking."
09/03	A woman woke in the middle of the night to find her husband
	missing from their bed.  In the stillness of the house, she could
	hear a muffled sound downstairs.  She went downstairs and looked
	all around, still not finding her husband.  Listening again, she
	could definitely hear moaning. She went down to the basement to
	find her husband, crouched in the corner facing the wall, crying.
	She asked him, "What's wrong with you?" He replied:  "Remember
	when your father caught us together, when you were 16?  Remember
	he said I had a choice: I could either marry you, or be sent away
	to prison for the next 20 years." Baffled, she said, "Yes."
	The husband bawled, "I would have been released from prison
	today." 
09/04	A man met a beautiful girl and she agreed to spend the night
	with him for $500.  So, they spent the night together.  In the
	morning, before he left, he told the girl that he did not have
	any cash with him, but that he would have his secretary write a
	check and mail it to her, calling the payment "Rent for
	Apartment." On the way to the office, he regretted what he had
	done, realizing that the whole event was not worth the price. 
	So, he sent a check for $250 and enclosed a note: "Dear Madam: 
	Enclosed find a check in the amount of $250 for rent of your
	apartment.  I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when
	I rented the apartment, I was under the impression that:
	  1.  It had never been occupied;
	  2.  there was plenty of heat;
	  3.  it was small enough to make me cozy and at home.
	Last night, however, I found out that it had been previously
	occupied, that there wasn't any heat, and that it was entirely
	too large." Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately sent
	back the following reply: "Dear Sir:  First of all, I cannot
	understand how you expect such a beautiful apartment to remain
	unoccupied indefinitely.  As for the heat, there is plenty of it
	if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the space, the apartment
	is indeed of regular size, but if you don't have enough furniture
	to fill it, please don't blame the landlord."
09/05	A little old lady went to the grocery store and put the most
	expensive cat food in her basket. She then went to the check
	out counter where she told the check out girl. "Nothing but the
	best for my little kitten on Christmas" The girl at the cash
	register said, "I'm sorry, but we cannot sell you cat food
	without proof that you have a cat.  A lot of old people buy cat
	food to eat, and the management wants proof that you are buying
	the cat food for your cat."  The little old lady went home,
	picked up her cat and brought it back to the store. They sold her
	the cat food. The next day, the old lady went to the store and
	bought 12 of the most expensive dog cookies - one for each day of
	Christmas. The cashier this time demanded proof that she now had
	a dog, claiming that old people sometimes eat dog food. 
	Frustrated she went home, came back and brought in her dog. She
	was then given the dog cookies. The next day she brought in a box
	with a hole in the lid. The little old lady asked the cashier to
	stick her finger in the hole. The cashier said, "No, you might
	have a snake in there."  The little old lady assured her that
	there was nothing in the box that would bite her.  So the cashier
	put her finger into the box and pulled it out and told the little
	old lady, "That smells like crap." The little old lady grinned
	from ear to ear, "Now, my dear, can I please buy three rolls of
	toilet paper?" Smile
09/06	First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship -
	he refers to it as "that time when me and Suzie were doing it on
	a semi-regular basis."  When a relationship ends, a woman will
	cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and then she will
	write a poem titled "All Men Are Idiots".  Then she will get on
	with her life.  A man has a little more trouble letting go.  Six
	months after the break-up, at 3:00 am, on a Saturday night, he
	will call and say, "I just wanted to let you know you ruined my
	life, and I'll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you're a
	total floozy.  But I want you to know that there's always a
	chance for us."  This is known as the "I Hate You/I Love You"
	drunken phone call, that 99% of all men have made at least
	once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men
	get over this need; alas, these classes rarely prove effective.
09/07	Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay - men prefer 30-40
	seconds of foreplay.  Men consider driving back to her place as
	part of the foreplay.
09/08	Women mature much faster than men.  Most 17 year old females
	can function as adults.  Most 17 year old males are still trading
	baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. 
	This is why high school romances rarely work out.
09/09	Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked women. 
	Women's magazines also feature pictures of naked women.  This is
	because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the
	male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light
	of day.  Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body. 
	Most naked men elicit laughter from women.
09/10	To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship.  They
	just chicken-scratch.  Women use scented, coloured stationary and
	they dot their "i's" with circles and hearts.  Women use
	ridiculously large loops in their "p's" and "g's".  It is a royal
	pain to read a note from a woman.  Even when she's dumping you,
	she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.
09/11	Let's say a small group of men and women are in a room,
	watching tv, and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on. 
	Immediately, the men will get very excited; they will laugh
	uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly, man's
	favourite stooge.  The women will roll their eyes and groan and
	wait it out.
09/12	A man has six items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, toothpaste,
	shaving cream, razor, a bar of dial soap, and a towel from the
	Holiday Inn.  The average number of items in the typical woman's
	bathroom is 437.  A man would not be able to identify most of
	these items.
09/13	A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the
	store and buys these things.  A man waits till the only items
	left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer.  Then he goes
	grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good.  by the
	time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed
	tighter than the Clampett's car on Beverly Hillbillies.  Of
	course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less
	lane.
09/14	When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit,
	and then slip on Reebok sneakers.  She will carry her dress shoes
	in a plastic bag from Saks.  When a woman gets to work, she will
	put on her dress shoes.  Five minutes later she will kick then
	off because her feet are under the desk.  A man will wear the
	same pair of shoes all day.
09/15	Leg warmers are sexy.  A woman, even if she's walking the dog or
	doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers.  She can wear
	them any time she wants.  A man can only wera leg warmers if he
	is auditioning for the "Gimme the Ball" number in "A Chorus
	Line".
09/16	When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready
	to go out.  When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means
	she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earring,
	finishes putting on her makeup...
09/17	Women love cats.  Men say they love cats, but when women
	aren't looking, men kick cats.
09/18	Ah, children.  A woman knows all about her children.  She
	knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances
	and best friends and favourite foods and secret fears and hopes
	and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in
	the house.
09/19	Let's say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on tv. 
	One of the boxers is felled by a low blow.  The woman says, "Oh,
	gee. That must have hurt."  Tha man groans and double over, and
	actually FEELS the pain.
09/20	A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants,
	empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. 
	A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals.
09/21	Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the
	earth.  Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always
	has a bad haircut.
09/22	Women do laundry every couple of days.  A man will wear every
	article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants
	that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his
	laundry.  When he is finally out of clothes, he will wera a dirty
	sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of
	clothes to the laundromat. Men expect to meet beautiful women at
	the laundromat.  This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old
	episodes of "Love, American Style"
09/23	When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about "the
	cermony". Men talk about "the bachelor party".
09/24	Men wear sensible socks.  They wear standard white
	sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks.  Socks that are cut way
	below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have
	a big fuzzy ball on the back.
09/25	If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle get together for
	lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and
	Michelle.  But if Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack go out for a brewsky,
	they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head,
	Godzilla, Peanut-Brain and Useless.
09/26	Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.
	Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in
	any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe
	Gargagiola's head.
09/27	When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of
	complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. 
	The nature and degree of these changes varies with the
	individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction - he
	buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving
	gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.
09/28	Little girls love to play with toys.  Then when they reach
	the age of 11 0r 12, they lose interest.  Men never grow out of
	their obsession with toys.  As they get older, their toys simply
	become more expensive and silly and impractical.  Examples of
	men's toys: little miniature tvs, car phones, complicated juicers
	and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve
	cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks beeps,
	and requires at least 6 "D" batteries to operate.
09/29	      CAUTION NEW VIRUSES!!!!!!!
	   Be on the lookout for any of these:
	
	Lewinsky virus: Sucks all the memory out of your computer, 
	then e-mails everyone about what it did.
	Ronald Reagan virus: Saves your data, but forgets where it 
	is stored.
	Mike Tyson virus: Quits after one byte.
	Oprah Winfrey virus: Your 300MB hard drive suddenly shrinks to
	100MB, and then slowly expands to 200MB.
	Dr. Jack Kevorkian virus: Deletes all old files.
	Ellen Degeneres virus: You can no longer insert disks into your
	computer.
	Titanic virus: Your whole computer goes down.
	Disney virus: Everything in your computer goes Goofy.
	Prozac virus: Screws up your RAM but your processor doesn't care.
09/30	An elderly couple was driving cross-country, and the woman was 
	driving. She gets pulled over by the highway patrol. The officer
	says, "Ma'am, did you know you were speeding?" The woman turns to
	her husband and asks, "What did he say?" The old man yells, "HE
	SAYS YOU WERE SPEEDING." The patrolman says, "May I see your
	license?" The woman turns to her husband and asks, "What did he
	say?" The old man yells, "HE WANTS TO SEE YOUR LICENSE."  The
	woman gives him her license. The patrolman says, "I see you are
	from Arkansas. I spent some time there once, had the worst sex
	with a woman I have ever had." The woman turns to her husband and
	asks," What did he say?" 
	"HE THINKS HE KNOWS YOU," the old man yells.
10/01	If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in
	unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask
	for directions. Men consider this to be a sign of weakness.  Men
	will never stop and ask for directions.  Men will drive in a
	circle for hours, all the while saying things like, "Looks like
	I've found a new way to get there." and "I know I'm in the
	general neighbourhood, I recognize that 7-11 store."
10/02	What's the difference between love, true love, and showing off? 
	Spitting, swallowing, and gargling. 
10/03	What is it when a man talks nasty to a woman? 
	Sexual harassment 
10/04	What is it when a woman talks nasty to a man?

	All of them were in one room with the Director and outside this one
	room were three smaller rooms that the men had seen on their way in.
	The Director stands up to talk to the men and says,
	'The CIA is a very select group. You have passed all of your other tests
	but there is one final test you must pass
	before you can come work for me.
	Did any of you see the three rooms outside this room on your way in?'
	The three men nod. 'Inside each room are your wives.
	The final test you must pass before you will be allowed
	to join the CIA is one of devotion and loyalty.
	One by one I want you men to go into the rooms your wife is in
	and I want you to kill your wife.' 

	"The Director picks one of the men and tells him that his wife is
	in the room with the big roman numeral I on it.
	He nods silently and takes the gun from the Director and walks out.
	A few minutes later, he comes back in and hands the gun to the Director.
	'I can't do it,' he says.
	'She was my high school sweetheart and I cannot kill her, no matter what

	"The Director tells him to leave and never come back.
	He hands the gun to the second man,
	who takes it and walks to the room with the roman numeral II on it,
	as he is told. A few minutes later he returns and is in tears.
	'Mr. Director, I am sorry, but I can not do what you ask.
	As much as I want to work for the CIA, I cannot kill my wife.
	She is my sole support and I need her.' 

	"He tells the man to be gone and hands the gun to the third man.
	After telling him that he could be his deputy director
	if he accomplishes the task, the man nods and leaves the room.
	Shortly after the Director hears the door with the
	roman numeral III shut, he hears the gunfire.
	Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam.
	And then there is silence for a few seconds.
	Immediately following the silence,
	he hears a loud commotion and some screaming.
	He hears what he thinks is furniture being overturned
	and items being broken, but he does not want to interrupt.
	This goes on for ten minutes and then the noise dies out completely,
	interrupted by silence.
	After a minute of silence,
	the man emerges and the Director asks him what the hell was going on
	in there. The man said, 'You mistakenly put blanks in the gun,
	so I had to strangle the bitch.'"

	So he asked the checkout girl if she could have some condoms brought
	up to register.She asked, "What size condoms?" The customer replied
	that he didn't know. She asked him to drop his pants.
	He did, she reached over the counter, grabbed hold of him,
	then picked up the store intercom and said
	"One box of large condoms to register 5."
	The next man in line thought this was interesting and,like most of us,
	up for a cheap thrill. When he got to the register, he told the checker
	that he too had forgotten to get condoms, and asked if she could have
	some brought up to the register. She asked him what size,
	and he stated that he didn't know. She asked him to drop his pants.
	He did, she gave him a quick feel, picked up the store 	intercom and said,
	"One box of medium sized condoms to register 5."
	A few customers back was this teen-aged boy.
	He thought what he had witnessed was way too cool.
	He had never had any type of sexual contact with a live female,
	so he thought this was his chance. When he got up to the register,
	he told the checker he needed some condoms.
	She asked him what size, and he said he didn't know.
	She asked him to drop his pants and he did. She reached over the counter,
	gave him one quick squeeze, then picked up the intercom and said,
	"Clean up at register 5!"

10/30	They always ask at the doctor's office why you are there,
	and you have to answer in front of others what's wrong --
	and sometimes it is embarrassing.
	There's nothing worse than a doctor's receptionist who insists
	you tell her what is wrong with you in a room full of other patients.
	I know most of us have experienced this, and I love the way this old
	guy handled it:
	A 65-year-old man walked into a crowded waiting room and approached
	the desk. The receptionist said,
	"Yes, sir, what are you seeing the doctor for today?"
	He replied, "There's something wrong with my dick."
	The receptionist became irritated and said,
	"You shouldnt come into a crowded waiting room and say things like that"
	"Why not? You asked me what was wrong, and I told you."
	The receptionist replied,
	"Now you've caused some embarrassment in this room full of people.
	You should have said there is something wrong with your ear and then
	discussed the problem further with the doctor in private."
	"You shouldn't ask people questions in a room full of strangers if
	the answer could embarrass anyone," the man said.
	Then he walked out and waited several minutes before re-entering.
	The receptionist smiled smugly and said, "Yes?"
	"There's something wrong with my ear."
	The receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled,
	knowing he had taken her advice. "And what is wrong with your ear, sir?"
	"I can't piss out of it."
	The waiting room erupted in laughter.

	romantic session, she turned on the lights.

11/04	A lady was filling her tank at a gas station, smoking a cigarette,
	even though all the signs say not to.
	The fumes that came out of the gas tank ignited,
	severely burning her hands.
	.
	But it also lit up her arm, too!
	.
	Instead of rolling on the ground to put it out, she panicked.
	She took off running down the street.
	.
	A police car was at the intersection where it happened and he tried
	to stop her to put out her arm, but she just kept running and screaming.
	All the officer could think of doing was to shoot her in the knee.
	This took everyone by surprise. The officer ran over to her and
	put the fire out, then called for an ambulance.
	.
	When questioned about his course of action to stop her, the officer said
	"My only thought was to stop her. After all, she was waving a fire-arm."
11/05	Two men were digging a ditch on a very hot day. One said to the other,
	"Why are we down in this hole digging a ditch when our boss is
	standing up there in the shade of a tree?" "I don't know," responded
	the other. "I'll ask him."
	.
	So he climbed out of the hole and went to his boss.
	"Why are we digging in the hot sun and you're standing in the shade?"
	"Intelligence," the boss said. "What do you mean, ‘intelligence'?"
	.
	The boss said, "Well, I'll show you. I'll put my hand on this tree and
	I want you to hit it with your fist as hard as you can."
	The ditch digger took a mighty swing and tried to hit the boss' hand.
	The boss removed his hand and the ditch digger hit the tree. The boss
	said, "That's intelligence!"
	.
	The ditch digger went back to his hole. His friend asked,
	"What did he say?" "He said we are down here because of intelligence."
	"What's intelligence?" said the friend.
	The ditch digger put his hand on his face and said,
	"Take your shovel and hit my hand."
11/06	One day an 85-year-old man is taking a stroll around his hometown,
	which he has lived in for his whole life. As he sees the landmarks,
	homes, and streets from his youth, he starts reminiscing....
	.
	"I remember helping build that bridge when I was 25.
	I worked hard on that. But people won't call you 'the bridge builder'
	if you do that here. No, no, they don't!"
	.
	"I remember building that house over there when I was 30.
	But people won't call you 'the house builder' if you do that.
	No, no they don't!"
	.
	"I remember building that tavern that I still lounge at when I was 35.
	If you do that people won't call you 'the tavern builder' either.
	They sure won't!"
	.
	"But if you fuck one goat......."
11/07	Twelve monks were about to be ordained. The final test was for them to
	line up, nude, in a garden while a nude model danced before them.
	Each monk had a small bell attached to his privates, and they were
	told that anyone whose bell rang would not be ordained because he had
	not reached a state of spiritual purity.
	.
	The model danced before the first monk candidate, with no reaction.
	She proceeded down the line with the same response until she got
	to the final monk. As she danced, his bell rang so loudly it fell off
	and clattered to the ground. Embarrassed, he bent down to pick up the
	bell, and eleven other bells began to ring......
11/08	It was the stir of the town when an 80-year-old man married a
	20-year-old girl. After a year she went into the hospital to give birth.
	The nurse came out to congratulate the fellow.
	"This is amazing. How do you do it at your age?" He answered,
	"You've got to keep that old motor running."
	The following year she gave birth again. The same nurse said,
	"You really are amazing. How do you do it?" He again said,
	"You've got to keep the old motor running."
	The same thing happened the next year. The nurse said,
	"You must be quite a man." He responded,
	"You've got to keep that old motor running."
	The nurse then said,
	"Well, you had better change the oil, this one's black."
11/09	A local law enforcement officer stopped a car for traveling faster than
	the posted speed limit. Since he was in a good mood that day he decided
	to give the poor fellow a break and write him out a warning instead of
	a ticket. So, he asks the man his name." Fred" he replies. "Fred what?"
	the officer asks. "Just Fred" the man responds. When the officer presses
	him for a last name, the man tells him that he used to have a last name
	but lost it. The officer thinks he has a nutcase on his hands but plays
	along with it. "Tell me Fred, how did you lose your last name?"
	.
	The man replies... "It's a long story so stay with me.
	I was born Fred Dingaling. I know, funny last name. The kids used to
	tease me all the time. So I stayed to myself. I studied hard and got
	good grades. When I got older I realized that I wanted to be a doctor.
	I went through college, medical school, internship, residency, finally
	got my degree so I was Fred Dingaling, MD. After a while I got bored
	being a doctor so I decided to go back to school.
	Dentistry was my dream. Got all the way through school,
	got my degree so I was now Fred Dingaling MD DDS.
	Got bored doing dentistry so I started fooling around with my assistant.
	She gave me VD. So, I was Fred Dingaling MD DDS with VD.
	Well, the ADA found out about the VD so they took away my DDS so
	I was Fred Dingaling MD with VD. Then the AMA found out about the ADA
	taking away my DDS because of the VD, so they took away my MD leaving
	me as Fred Dingaling with VD. Then the VD took away my dingaling so now
	I'm just Fred."
	The officer let him go without even a warning.
11/10	A farmer and his wife were lying in bed one evening; she was knitting,
	and he was reading the latest issue of Animal Husbandry. He looked up
	from the page and said to her, "Did you know that humans are the only
	species in which the female achieves orgasm?" She looked at him
	wistfully, smiled, and replied, "Oh, yeah? Prove it." He frowned for
	a moment, then said, "Okay." He got up and walked out, leaving his wife
	with a confused look on her face. About a half hour later, he returned
	all tired and sweaty and proclaimed, "Well, I'm sure the cow and sheep
	didn't, but the way that pig is always squealing, how can I tell?"
11/11	Three women were sitting around talking about their husbands'
	performance as a lover. The first woman says

	me around sometimes. I kinda like that." The third woman just shakes her
	head and says, "My husband works for Microsoft. He just sits on the edge
	of the bed and tells me how great it's going to be when I get it."
11/12	Nina and Liz are having a conversation during there lunch break.
	Nina asks, "So, Liz, how's your sex life these days?" Liz replies,

	"Yeah, you get a little each month, but it's not enough to live on."
11/13	A nurse from England was on duty in the emergency department,
	when a punk rocker entered. The patient had purple hair,
	plus a variety of tattoos and strange clothing.
	It was quickly determined that the patient had acute appendicitis,
	so she scheduled for immediate surgery.
	When she was completely disrobed on the operating table,
	the surgeons noticed that her pubic hair had been dyed green,
	and just above it there was a tattoo which read, "Keep off the grass."
	After the surgical procedure was completed, the surgeon added a small
	note to the dressing which said, "Sorry, had to mow the lawn."

	sleeping carriage of a train. After the initial embarrassment they both
	go to sleep, the man on the top bunk, the woman on the lower.
	In the middle of the night the man leans over, wakes the woman and says,
	"I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm awfully cold and I was wondering if
	you could possibly get me another blanket?" The woman leans out and,
	with a glint in her eye, says, " I have a better idea, just for tonight,
	let's make pretend that we're married!" The man says happily,
	"OK!" AWESOME!" The woman says, "GOOD .... Get your own fucking blanket!
11/16	An 80-year old man was having his annual check-up and the doctor asked
	him how he was feeling. "I've never been better!" he boasted.
	"I've got an eighteen year old bride who's pregnant and having my child!
	What do you think about that?"
	.
	The doctor considered this for a moment, then said,
	"Let me tell you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter.
	He never missed a season. But one day, he went out in a bit of a hurry,
	and he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun."
	The doctor continued, "So he was in the woods, and suddenly a grizzly
	bear appeared in front of him! He raised up his umbrella, pointed it at
	the bear and squeezed the handle. And do you know what happened?" the
	doctor queried. Dumbfounded, the old man replied, "No."
	The doctor continued, "The bear dropped dead in front of him!"
	"That's impossible!" exclaimed the old man.
	"Someone else must have shot that bear."
	.
	"That's kind of what I'm getting at," replied the doctor.
	.
	A man goes to a doctor and says " What shall I do?
	I've just been raped by an elephant!"
	The doctor tells him to bend over so he can have a look at his ass.
	"That's funny!" He says "your asshole is 10 inches wide!
	I thought elephants only had thin long dicks?" The man says
	"Yeah but he fingered me first!"
11/17	A mother and daughter loved to play around.
	They partied everyday and always ended up fucking everybody around.
	Their holes were played until they became seasoned and loose.
	One day, the daughter met the man of her dreams and decided to get
	married. Now, the man did not know about their flicks and thought the
	daughter was still a virgin. So he decided to leave any lovemaking until
	their wedding night. The daughter began to worry about the condition of
	her hole and consulted her mother, "Mum, I'm worried, what will Peter do
	if he finds out about my hole?!!" Mother said,
	"Don't worry dear, I will teach you a way to fool your husband-to-be.
	Here's what you do, place an apple in your hole and it will be tight and
	he won't even notice it." So the daughter did what her mother taught her
	and everything went well and the stupid husband didn't even notice.
	This went on for a few months. Now, everytime the daughter wanted to
	bathe, she would take out the apple and place it on the wash basin and
	after bathing, she would put it back in her hole.
	One day, after bathing, she forgot to put it back and left it on the
	wash basin. The husband came into the washroom and saw the apple and
	thought that her wife left the apple for him and he ate it,
	"Honey, thanks for the apple. It tasted great!"
	Shocked, the daughter dare not tell her husband about it and went to
	consult her mother, "Mum, I'm in deep shit now!
	I took out the apple while I was bathing and I forgot to put it back and
	Peter found the apple I left on the wash basin and ate it!
	What sould I do? Will he be poisoned? I'm scared, mum." Mother said,
	"Don't worry dear, a few years ago, your father ate the WATERMELON
	I left in the washroom and he lived!"
11/18	There was an Amish girl that had just come of age to date.
	Her mother was helping her get ready to go out that night.

	cold that night,and the Amish still ride in buggies. Her mother asked,
	"why are you wearing gloves?" She continued by saying that it wasn't
	lady like to wear gloves. The Girl said to her mother,
	"its suppose to be cold tonight, what do I do with my hands if they get
	cold?" Her mother replied. "just stick your hands between your knees,
	and they will get warm." So the girl agreed. Her date picked her up and
	they went on there was. On their way home her hands got cold,
	so following her mother's orders, she stuck her hands between her knees.
	Her date looked over and said, "what on earth do you have your hands
	between your legs for?" She replied, " my mother told me that if my 
	ands got cold, to stick them between my legs to get them warm."
	Her date said to her, " well my dick is frozen solid do you care if I
	stick it between your legs to get it warm?" The girl said,
	"well I don't see any harm in it." So he did.
	After returning home from her date she asked her mother," 
	What do you know about them there dicks?" Her mother said,
	"Why what do you know about dicks?"
	The girl looked at her mother and said,
	"All I know is that when they thaw out they make an awful mess!"
11/19	Once upon a time in a land far away, a beautiful, independent,
	self-assured princess happened upon a frog as she sat contemplating
	ecological issues on the shores of an unpolluted pond in a verdant
	meadow near her castle.
	.
	The frog hopped into the princess' lap and said: Elegant Lady,
	I was once a handsome prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me.
	One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper young
	prince that I am, and then, my sweet, we can marry and set up
	housekeeping in your castle with my mother, where you can prepare my
	meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and feel forever grateful
	doing so.
	.
	That night, as the princess dined sumptuously on a repast of lightly
	saut�ed frogs legs seasoned in a wine and onion cream sauce she chuckled
	to herself and thought: I don't fucking think so.
11/20	This farmer has about 200 hens, but no rooster and he wants chicks.
	So, he goes down the road to the next farmer and asks if he
	has a rooster. The other farmer says,
	"Yeah, I've got this great rooster, named Randy;
	he'll service every chicken you've got. No problem."
	.
	Well , Randy the rooster is a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd
	be worth it. So , he buys Randy. The farmer takes Randy home and sets
	him down in the barnyard, giving the rooster a pep talk,
	"Randy, I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to
	service here and you cost me a lot of money and I'll need you to do a
	good job. So, take your time and have some fun,"
	the farmer said with a chuckle.
	.
	Randy seemed to understand, so the farmer points towards the hen house
	and Randy took off like a shot ~WHAM~ He nails every hen on there THREE
	or FOUR times and the farmer is just shocked. Randy runs out of the hen
	house and sees a flock of geese down by the lake ~WHAM~ He gets all the
	geese. Randy's up in the pigpen. He's in with the cows. Randy is jumping
	on every animal the farmer owns.
	.
	The farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even
	last the day. Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up the next
	day to find Randy dead as a doorknob in the middle of the yard.
	Buzzards are circling overhead.
	.
	The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful animal ,
	shakes his head and says, "Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself.
	I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to yourself."
	Randy opens one eye, nods towards the sky and say's,
	"Shhh. They're getting closer...."
11/21	A lecturer teaching medicine was tutoring a class on 'Observation'.
	He took out a jar of yellow-colored liquid. "This", he explained,
	"is urine. To be a doctor, you have to be observant to color,
	smell, sight, and taste."
	.
	After saying this, he dipped his finger into the jar and put it into his
	mouth. His class watched on in amazement, most, in disgust.
	But being the good students that they were, the jar was passed,
	and one by one, they dipped one finger into the jar
	and then put it into their mouth.
	.
	After the last student was done, the lecturer shook his head.
	"If any of you had been observant, you would have noticed that I put my
	2nd finger into the jar and my 3rd finger into my mouth."
11/22		Two women had been having a friendly lunch when the subject turned to
	sex. "You know, John and I have been having some sexual problems",
	Linda told her friend. "That's amazing!" Mary replied, "So have Tom and
	I. We're thinking of going to a sex therapist", said Linda.
	"Oh, we could never do that! We'd be too embarrassed!", responded Mary.
	"But after you go, will you please tell me how it went?"
	.
	Several weeks passed, and the two friends met for lunch again.
	"So how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?", Mary asked.
	"Things couldn't be better!", Linda exclaimed.
	"We began with a physical exam, and afterward the doctor said he was
	certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on the
	way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told us to sit
	on the floor nude, and toss the grapes and donuts at each other.
	Every grape that went into my vagina, John had to get it out with his
	tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat.
	Our sex life is wonderful, in fact it's better than it's ever been!"
	.
	With that endorsement Mary talked her husband into an appointment with
	the same sex therapist. After the physical exams were completed the
	doctor called Mary and Tom into his office. "I'm afraid there is
	nothing I can do for you," he said. "But doctor," Mary complained,
	"you did such good for Linda and John, surely you must have a suggestion
	for us! Please, please, can't you give us some help? Any help at all?"
	"Well, OK," the doctor answered. "On your way home, I want you to stop
	at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples and a box of cheerios..."
11/23	A Doctor recently had a patient "drop" in on him for an unscheduled
	appointment. "What can I do for you today?" the Doctor asked.
	The aged Gentleman replied: "Doctor, you must help me.
	Every time I make love to my wife, my eyes get all bleary,
	my legs go weak, I can hardly catch my breath....
	Doctor, I'm scarred!"
	.
	The Doctor, looking at his 86 year old patient, said:
	"Mr. Smith, these sensations tend to happen over time,
	especially to a man of your advanced years, but tell me,
	when did you first notice these symptoms?"
	The old gent's response was:
	"Well... three times last night, and twice again this morning!"
11/24	Little Johnny and Susie were only 10 years old, but they just knew that
	they were in love. One day they decided that they wanted to get married
	so Johnny went to Susie's father to ask him for her hand.
	Johnny bravely walked up to him and said
	"Mr. Smith, me and Susie are in love and I want to ask you for her hand
	in marriage."
	.
	Thinking that this was the cutest thing, Mr. Smith replied,
	"Well Johnny, you are only 10. Where will you two live?" 
	Without even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replied
	"In Susie's room. Its bigger than mine and we can both fit there nicely.
	.
	Still thinking this is just adorable, Mr. Smith said with a huge grin,
	"Okay then how will you live? You're not old enough to get a job. You'll
	need to support Susie." Again, Johnny instantly replied,
	"Our allowance...Susie makes 5 bucks a week and I make 10 bucks a week.
	That's about 60 bucks a month, and that'll do us just fine."
	By this time Mr. Smith was a little shocked that Johnny had put so much
	thought into this. So, he thought for a moment trying to come up with
	something that Johnny wouldn't have an answer for.
	After a second, Mr. Smith said,
	"Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything all figured out.
	just have one more question for you.
	What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?"
	.
	Johnny just shrugged his shoulders and said,
	"Well, we've been lucky so far...."
11/25	A man is telling a story... "I was playing golf, and even though I am
	usually a pretty good player, I was playing horribly that day. 
	As I was about to tee off at the fourth hole I heard a voice say,
	"three wood." I looked around and no one was behind me so I took
	my stance.  Then once again I heard "three wood."  I looked down and
	there was a frog at the corner of the tee box, and he was telling me
	to use my three wood. I thought it was stupid but I was playing so badly
	that I thought nothing could hurt me so I took out my three wood.
	It was a long par four, and I hit the ball straight 250 yards with that
	three wood.  Since the frog seemed to be lucky I picked him up and took
	him along with me.  At the next whole he told me to use my five iron.
	It was a par three and I got my first hole in one ever.
	I made a least a birdie on all the rest of the holes,
	and all I had to do was listen to that frog.
	.
	That night I took the frog to the casino in my hotel.
	We played Roulette.  I put my money where the frog said and won on
	every spin of the wheel. After that I was tired so I went up to bed.
	I took the frog out of my pocket and put it on the dresser.
	Suddenly it looked at me and said, "kiss me."
	Now I wasn't about to kiss a frog, but he said it again.
	So I kissed the frog and he turned into the most beautiful fourteen year
	old girl you have ever seen in your entire life. And that your honor is
	how that fourteen year old girl ended up in my hotel room.
11/26	This guy goes into a whorehouse and tells the mistress he wants to eat
	out a girl for the first time. She sends him up and he meets this
	deadly blonde chick. She whips down her pants and he starts licking
	her twat. Minutes later he feels something in his mouth and spits out
	a corn niblet. Thinking this is normal, as he has never done it before
	continues eating her out. Minutes pass and he finds a piece of carrot
	in his mouth. Still thinking this is normal he continues.
	Soon after he finds a piece of meat and stands up.
	"Excuse me miss, but are you sick?" She looks at him and replies
	"No, but the last guy was!"
11/27	The manager hired a new secretary. she was young, sweet, and polite.
	One day while taking dictation, she noticed his fly was open.
	While leaving the room, she courteously said,
	"Oh sir, did you know that your barracks door was open."
	He did not understand her remark, but later on happened to look down
	and saw that his zipper was open.
	He decided to have some fun with his new employee.
	.
	Calling her in, he asked, "By the way, Miss Jones, when you saw my
	barracks door open this morning, did you also see a soldier standing
	at attention." The secretary, who was quite witty, replied,
	"Why, no sir, all I saw was a little disabled veteran,
	sitting on two duffel bags!"
11/28	An old lady is rocking away the last of her days on her front porch,
	reflecting on her long life, when, all of a sudden, a fairy godmother
	appears in front of her and informs her that she will be granted
	three wishes.
	.
	"Well, now," says the old lady, "I guess I would like to be really,
	really rich." ***POOF*** her rocking chair turns to solid gold.
	She smiles and says, "Gee, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young,
	beautiful princess."
	***POOF*** she turns into a beautiful young woman.
	.
	"Your third wish?" asked the fairy godmother.
	Just then the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front of them.
	"Ooh...can you change him into a handsome prince?" she asks.
	***POOF*** there before her stands a young man more handsome than anyone
	could possibly imagine.
	.
	She stares at him, smitten. With a smile that makes her knees weak.
	He saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear:
	"Bet you're sorry you had me neutered!"
11/29	A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where he had
	been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the fencing of the
	compound, he felt grass under his little feet and saw the dawn breaking
	for the first time in his life. "Wow, this is great," he thought.
	It wasn't long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing under it
	he saw a wonderful sight: lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and
	nibbling at the lush grass.
	.
	Hey," he called. "I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've just escaped
	Are you wild rabbits?"
	.
	"Yes. Come and join us," they cried. Our friend hopped over to them and
	started eating the grass. It tasted so good.
	"What else do you wild rabbits do?" he asked. "Well," one of them said.
	"You see that field there? It's got carrots growing in it.
	We dig them up and eat them."
	This he couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most
	succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again,
	"What else do you do?"
	.
	"You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it.
	We eat them as well." The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned
	a while later completely full. "Is there anything else you guys do?"
	he asked. One of the other rabbits came a bit closer to him and spoke
	softly. "There's one other thing you must try.
	You see those rabbits there," he said, pointing to the far corner of
	the field. "They're girls. We shag them. Go and try it."
	Well, our friend spent the rest of the morning screwing his little heart
	out until, completely knackered, he staggered back over to the guys.
	"That was fantastic,"he panted. "So are you going to live with us then?"
	one of them asked. "I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't."
	The wild rabbits all stared at him, a bit surprised.
	"Why? We thought you liked it here."
	.
	"I do," our friend replied.
	"But I must get back to the laboratory. I'm dying for a cigarette."
11/30	Deep within a forest, a little turtle began to climb a tree.
	After hours of effort, he reached the top, jumped into the air waving
	his front legs and crashed to the ground. After recovering, he slowly
	climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell to the ground. The turtle tried
	again and again, while a couple of birds sitting on a branch watched his
	sad efforts. Finally, the female bird turned to her mate. "Dear,"
	she chirped, "I think it's time to tell him he's adopted."
12/01	The class assignment in composition was to write about something unusual
	that happened during the past week. Little Irving got up to read his.
	"Papa fell in the well last week - " he began. "Good heavens," shrieked
	Mrs. Kroop, the teacher. "Is he all right now?" "He must be,"
	said little Irving. "He stopped yelling for help yesterday."
12/02	A man went to his doctor seeking help for his terrible addiction to
	cigars. The doctor was quite familiar with his very compulsive patient,
	so recommended an unusual and quite drastic form of aversion therapy.
	"When you go to bed tonight, take one of your cigars, unwrap it,
	and stick it completely up your asshole. Then remove it, rewrap it,
	and place it back with all the others in such a fashion as you can't
	tell which one it is. The aversion is obvious: you won't dare smoke any
	of them, not knowing which is the treated cigar."
	"Thanks doc, I'll try it." And he did. But three weeks later he came
	back and saw the doctor again. "What? My recommendation didn't work?
	It was supposed to be effective even in the most addictive of cases,
	such as yours is!" "Well, it kind of worked, doc. At least I was able
	to transfer my addiction," said the patient. "What in the hell is that
	supposed to mean?" "Well, I don't smoke cigars anymore, but now I can't
	go to sleep at night unless I have a cigar shoved up my ass..."
12/03	A man in a bar sees a friend at a table, drinking by himself.
	Approaching the friend, he comments,
	"You look terrible. What's the problem?" "My mother died in June,
	and left me $10,000." said the friend. "Gee, that's tough," he replied.
	"Then in July," the friend continued,
	"My father died, leaving me $50,000." The man looking concerned says,
	"Wow. Two parents gone in two months. No wonder you're depressed."

	"if I let one of my students do it, I suppose I can knock the price
	down to $10." "Marvelous," says the man,

	A woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled for a trip to
	Rome with her husband.. She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser,
	who responded:
	"Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty..
	You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?"
	"We're taking Continental," was the reply. "We got a great rate!"
	"Continental?" exclaimed the hairdresser." That's a terrible airline.
	Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're
	always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?"
	"We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome 's Tiber River
	called Teste."
	"Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks its gonna
	be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump."
	"We're going to go to see the Vatican and maybe get to see the Pope.."
	"That's rich," laughed the hairdresser. You and a million other people
	trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this
	lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it."
	A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. The hairdresser
	asked her about her trip to Rome .
	"It was wonderful," explained the woman, "not only were we on time in
	one of Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked, and they
	bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had
	a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot.
	And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling 
	ob, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were
	overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no
	extra charge!"
	"Well," muttered the hairdresser, "that's all well and good, but I know
	you didn't get to see the Pope."
	"Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican,
	a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope
	likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step
	into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me.
	Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and

	I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had forgotten
	to make. I found the number, and dialed it. A man answered saying,
	"Hello?" I politely said, "This is Fred Hanifin, could I please speak
	with Robin Carter?" Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me.
	I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude.
	I tracked down Robin's correct number, and called her.
	(I had transposed the last two digits of her phone number).
	After hanging up with her, I decided to call the "wrong number" again.
	When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, "You're an asshole!"
	and hung up.
	I wrote his number down, with the word "asshole" next to it, 
	and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying
	bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell,
	"You're an asshole!". It always cheered me up.
	When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my therapeutic "asshole"
	calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said,
	"Hi, this is John Smith from the Telephone Company.
	I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with the Caller ID program?"
	he yelled, "NO!" and slammed the phone down.
	I quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're an asshole!"
	So, one day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a
	parking spot. Some boy in a black BMW cut me off, and pulled into the
	spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I had
	been waiting for the spot. The idiot ignored me. I noticed a "For Sale"
	sign in his car window, so I wrote down his number.
	A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole
	(I had his number on speed dial), I thought I had better call the BMW
	asshole, too.. I dialed and someone said, "Hello?" I said,
	"Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?" "Yes it is.
	Can you tell me where I can see it?"
	"Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street.
	It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front."
	"What's your name?" I asked. "My name is Don Hansen," he said.
	"When's a good time to catch you, Don?"
	"I'm home every evening after five."
	"Listen, Don, can I tell you something?" "Yes?" "Don, you're an asshole"
	Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.
	Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call...
	But after several months of calling them, it wasn't as enjoy- able as it
	used to be. So, I came up with an idea: I called Asshole #1.
	"Hello" "You're an asshole!" (but I didn't hang up).
	"Are you still there?" he asked. "Yeah", I said. "Stop calling me",
	he screamed "Make me", I said. "Who are you?" he asked.
	"My name is Don Hansen." "Yeah?" "Where do you live?"
	"Asshole, I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a yellow house with my black
	Beemer parked in front." He said, "I'm coming over right now, Don.
	And you had better start saying your prayers." I said,
	"Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole."
	Then I called asshole #2. "Hello?" he said. "Hello Asshole", I said...
	He yelled, "If I ever find out who you are...." "You'll what?" I said.
	"I'll kick your ass", he exclaimed. I answered,
	"Well, asshole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now".
	Then, I hung up, and immediately called the police, saying that I lived
	at 1802 West 34th Street, and I was on my way over there to kill my gay
	lover. Then, I called Channel 13 news about the gang war going down on
	West 34th Street... I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th
	Street.
	There, I saw two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front
	of 6 squad cars, a police helicopter, and a news crew.
	Now, I feel better.

	4. Shooting is not too good for my enemies.
	.
	5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on
	the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons
	of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box.
	.
	6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.
	.
	7. When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and asks,
	"Or are you afraid without your armies to back you up?” my reply will be
	"No, just sensible."
	.
	8. When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill

	I'll say, "No" and shoot him.

	.
	11. I will not order my trusted lieutenant to kill the infant who

	- I'm not accountable to anyone and my other enemies wouldn't believe

	before implementation.
	.
	17. All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds
	of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the
	cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying
	celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.
	.
	18. My undercover agents will not have tattoos identifying them as
	members of my organization, nor will they be required to wear military
	boots or adhere to any other dress codes.
	.
	19. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette,
	or any other form of last request.
	.
	20. I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. 
	If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, 
	I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is
	just putting his plan into operation.
	.
	21. I will design all doomsday machines myself.
	If I must hire a mad scientist to assist me, I will make sure that he is
	sufficiently twisted to never regret his evil ways and seek to undo the
	damage he's caused.
	.
	22. I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there's
	just one thing I want to know."
	.
	23. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to
	their advice.
	.
	24. I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt
	to usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction 
	t a crucial point in time.
	.
	25. I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was
	evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray
	her own father.
	.
	26. Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in 
	maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected
	developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to.
	.
	27. I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original uniforms
	for my legions of terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make
	them look like Nazi storm troopers, Roman foot 	soldiers, or savage
	Mongol hordes. All were eventually defeated and I want my troops to have
	a more positive mind-set.
	.
	28. No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power,
	I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.
	.
	29. I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops
	in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my
	power generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless
	-- my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with
	spears and rocks.
	.
	30. I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and
	weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job,
	at least I will never utter the line
	"No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!"
	(After that, death is usually instantaneous.)
	.
	31. No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort
	of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and
	virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.
	.
	32. If I am engaged in a duel to the death with the hero and I am
	fortunate enough to knock the weapon out of his hand, I will graciously
	allow him to retrieve it. This is not from a sense of fair play; rather,
	it gives me the opportunity to kill him while he is distracted.
	.
	33. No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, 	
	there is probably someone just as attractive who is not desperate to
	kill me. Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent
	to my bed chamber.
	.
	34. I will never build only one of anything important. For the same
	reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all 
	times.
	.
	35. If my supreme command center comes under attack, I will immediately
	flee to safety in my prepared escape pod and direct the defenses from
	there. I will not wait until the troops break into my inner sanctum to
	attempt this.
	.
	36. My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot
	escape and into which I could not accidentally stumble.
	.
	37. Even though I don't really care because I plan on living forever,
	I will hire engineers who are able to build me a fortress sturdy enough
	that, if I am slain, it won't tumble to the ground for 	no good
	structural reason.
	.
	38. I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies
	into confusion.
	.
	39. All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and
	cowardly thieves in the land will be pre-emptivly put to death.
	My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no
	source of comic relief.
	.
	40. All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with
	surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected
	reinforcement and/or romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.
	.
	41. Any and all magic and/or technology that can miraculously resurrect
	a secondary character who has given up his/her life through self
	sacrifice will be outlawed and destroyed.
	.
	42. I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad
	news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard
	to come by.
	.
	43. I will see to it that plucky young lads/lasses in strange clothes
	and with the accent of an outlander shall REGULARLY climb some monument
	in the main square of my capital and denounce me, claim to know the
	secret of my power, rally the masses to rebellion, etc. That way, the
	citizens will be jaded in case the real thing ever comes along.
	.
	44. I won't require high-ranking female members of my organization to
	wear a stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual
	dress-code. Similarly, outfits made entirely from black 
	leather will be reserved for formal occasions.
	.
	45. I will not employ devious schemes that involve the hero's party
	getting into my inner sanctum before the trap is sprung.
	.
	46. I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.
	.
	47. I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look
	diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member
	of Generation X.
	.
	48. I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell
	block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners,
	I will keep the only key to the cell door on my person instead 
	of handing out copies to every bottom-rung guard in the prison.
	.
	49. If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing
	a battle, I will believe him. After all, he's my trusted lieutenant.
	.
	50. If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring
	anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately,
	instead of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance
	towards me in my old age.
	.
	51. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at
	the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite
	number among his army.
	.
	52. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable
	super weapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead
	of keeping it in reserve.
	.
	53. Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky time-travel
	devices.
	.
	54. I will offer oracles the choice of working exclusively for me
	or being executed. Those that take more than two seconds to respond
	will be killed either way.
	.
	55. When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog,
	monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable
	of untying ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around.
	Not that the key will be anywhere near the hero.
	.
	56. I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the
	beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good
	looks and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her in
	on my plans. I will then lie to her, and see if she betrays me.
	.
	57. I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. 
	Those who work for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like
	even the odds to give the other guy a sporting chance.
	.
	58. I will not rely entirely upon "totally reliable" spells that can be
	neutralized by relatively inconspicuous talisman.
	.
	59. I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible
	for what in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will 
	ot draw my weapon, point it at him, say "And here is the price for
	failure," then suddenly turn and kill some random, totally reliable
	underling.
	.
	60. If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can one
	man possibly do?” I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.
	.
	61. If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me,
	I will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for
	him to mature.
	.
	62. I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology
	with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken,
	it will not immediately come after me for revenge.
	.
	63. If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me,
	I will not send all my troops out to seize it.
	Instead I will send them out to seize something else and quietly put a 
	Want-Ad in the local paper.
	.
	64. My main computers will have their own special operating system that
	will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh power
	books. They will also have a virus protection program 	-- just in case.
	.
	65. I will make the main entrance to my fortress standard-sized.
	While elaborate 60-foot high double-doors definitely impress the masses,
	they are hard to close quickly in an emergency.
	.
	66. If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the
	conditions in the beautiful princess' cell, I will immediately
	transfer him to a less people-oriented position.
	.
	67. I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to
	examine my castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned
	tunnels that I might not know about.
	.
	68. If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I'll never marry you!
	Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!" I will say "Oh well'' and kill her.
	.
	69. I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to 
	double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.
	.
	70. Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance
	I will provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access.
